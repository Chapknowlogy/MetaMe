# MetaMe 3D
MetaMe gives users their own voxel-based 3D plot in the metaverse
-----
Inspiration
As a designer and developer, I've built both Web2 and Web3 (.eth) sites — but I’ve always felt limited by centralized platforms and static pages. I wanted to build something truly decentralized and expressive. When I discovered Metaverse Markup Language (MML), Blocks of Bitcoin, and Nakamoto Matrix, I realized I could finally create a 3D, ownable, Bitcoin-secured digital identity — one that brings creativity, permanence, and self-sovereignty together.

What it does
MetaMe gives users their own voxel-based 3D plot in the metaverse, functioning like a spatial website.
It’s a digital identity you can walk through — where individuals or brands can showcase their:

On-chain credentials
Ordinals, NFTs, or digital art
Social links or .eth/.btc handles
Personal or brand story
All of it lives on a decentralized stack, powered by Bitcoin infrastructure.

How we built it
Metaverse Markup Language (MML): Used to build and script the 3D scene.
Blocks of Bitcoin / Nakamoto Matrix: Provided the spatial and ownership layer for each plot.
**Custom JavaScript-driven animations and GLTF assets: Used JavaScript to add interactive and animated behaviors within the 3D scene, alongside custom GLTF models for digital identity elements.
Design-first approach: Every scene was built to feel intentional, not templated.
Challenges we ran into
Learning the MML syntax and tooling was a steep but rewarding curve.
Optimizing asset load time and layout in 3D space required iteration.
Integrating identity elements in a decentralized, Bitcoin-native way posed new UX challenges.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a working prototype of a decentralized 3D identity site — no IPFS or DNS needed.
Designed and coded a fully custom MML scene without using templates.
Established a repeatable framework for others to create their own MetaMe plots.
What we learned
MML opens exciting creative possibilities for 3D on-chain experiences.
Bitcoin can be a powerful backbone for more than just currency — it's a foundation for identity.
Spatial design is the next layer of personal presence on the web.
What's next for MetaMe
Custom plot builder UI so anyone can generate their own MetaMe without code.
Identity integrations with ENS, Nostr, and other Web3 protocols.
Unreal Engine connection for expanded visuals and interactivity.
Decentralized discovery layer to explore other MetaMe plots across the Nakamoto Matrix.
MetaMe is just the start — we’re redefining what it means to “own your presence” in the metaverse.
